This study examines two proposed mechanisms underlying the ~100-kyr glacial cycles of the Pleistocene:  
(1) **insolation-driven glacial terminations**, and  
(2) **phase-locking between internal ice-sheet oscillators and orbital forcing**.

Using conceptual models, we characterize how each mechanism produces distinct timing, amplitude, and frequency features in ice volume variability. We also identify observational signatures that can help distinguish between the two scenarios in paleoclimate data.
