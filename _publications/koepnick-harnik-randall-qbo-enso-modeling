Building on our observational and CMIP6 analysis, this companion paper explores whether ENSO–QBO correlations can be generated through well-defined physical mechanisms. We use a wave-driven simple model and investigate the impact of wave amplitude modulation from seasonality and ENSO effects.

This aims to determine whether these mechanisms can reproduce the magnitude, sign, and intermittency of ENSO–QBO correlations seen in observations. In continution of other work, we aim to evaluate whether ENSO–QBO coupling reflects a **real, dynamically reproducible teleconnection** or a **statistical coincidence** of short records.
