This study examines the robustness of the observed ENSO–QBO relationship using reanalysis products and CMIP6 preindustrial control simulations. We evaluate whether the commonly reported correlation between ENSO amplitude and QBO phase represents a true dynamical coupling or arises from sampling variability given the short observational record (~40 years)
