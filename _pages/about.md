I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University studying **climate dynamics** across the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere. My research combines theory, numerical modeling, and climate data analysis to understand variability across time scales, including large-scale modes such as ENSO and the QBO as well as high-latitude processes involving ice–atmosphere–ocean interactions.

Much of my work uses **model hierarchies**—from conceptual models to large climate models (CESM2)—to investigate mechanisms of climate variability and the feedbacks that structure the climate system. I also study the dynamics of past climates, including the evolution of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation.

I am currently seeking **postdoctoral research opportunities** beginning in fall of 2027.
