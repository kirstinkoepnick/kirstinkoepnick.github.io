I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University advised by Eli Tziperman. My research focuses on **climate dynamics** across the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere, using model hierarchies, numerical modeling, and climate data analysis.

I am particularly interested in how large-scale variability, sea ice, and ice sheets interact to shape climate across seasonal to glacial time scales. My work spans past and present climates, including the evolution of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last glacial cycle and the sensitivity of surface mass balance to climate forcing and feedbacks.

I am currently seeking **postdoctoral research opportunities beginning in fall 2027**.
