I enjoy teaching and mentoring at the intersection of mathematics and climate science, and have worked with students at both Harvard University and Bates College.

Currently, I am advising an undergraduate student at Harvard University on a project working on using machine learning techniques to classify and understand westerly wind bursts.

## Harvard University — Teaching Fellow
