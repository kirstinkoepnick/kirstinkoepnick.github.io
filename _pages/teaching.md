I enjoy teaching and mentoring at the intersection of mathematics and climate science, and have worked with students at both Harvard University and Bates College.

Currently, I am advising an undergraduate student at Harvard University on a project working on using machine learning techniques to classify and understand westerly wind bursts.

## Harvard University — Teaching Fellow

- **Linear Algebra & Big Data** (Spring 2025)  
- **Paleoclimate as a Proxy** (Spring 2024)  
- **Global Warming** (Spring 2023)  

## Bates College — Teaching Assistant, Grader, and Tutor

**Teaching Assistant**
- Introduction to Abstraction (Fall 2020)  
- Linear Algebra (Spring 2019–2022)  
- Multivariable Calculus (Fall 2019–2022)

**Grader**
