# Research Overview

My research focuses on climate dynamics across the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere, with an emphasis on understanding variability on seasonal to glacial time scales. I use a combination of theory, numerical modeling, climate data analysis, and model hierarchies to study interactions between large-scale modes, ice-sheet evolution, and feedbacks in the climate system.

# Current Research Themes

## ENSO–QBO Interactions
I investigate whether correlations between ENSO variability and QBO phase represent a robust dynamical coupling or arise from sampling uncertainty in the short observational record. This includes analysis of reanalysis products, CMIP6 control simulations, and mechanistic modeling.

## Ice–Atmosphere–Ocean Coupling and Deglaciation
I study how the surface mass balance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet evolved across deglaciation using isotope-enabled transient climate simulations. My work examines the climate factors that drove growth near 80 ka and retreat near 12 ka, and identifies feedbacks that shaped the timing and magnitude of glacial transitions.

## Model Hierarchies and Climate Variability
Across multiple projects, I develop and apply model hierarchies—from simple dynamical models to CESM2—to isolate the mechanisms driving climate variability, assess sensitivity to forcing, and separate internal variability from externally driven responses.

# Methods
- Climate model analysis (CESM2, CMIP, PMIP, iTRACE)  
- Statistical and dynamical diagnostics of variability  
- Simple and intermediate-complexity modeling  
- Surface mass balance modeling  
- Ice–climate feedback analysis
